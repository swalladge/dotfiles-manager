Experimental dotfiles manager in rust. (alpha quality)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swalladge/dotfiles-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swalladge/dotfiles-manager)

# About

This is a project for PRT455 (Software Engineering Practice).
The idea is to build a dotfiles manager that is fast, stable, and features the
best from a selection of other dotfiles managers and community interest.

Direction for the project taken from initial research, documented in the
[project plan](docs/PRT455-project-plan-SamuelWalladge.pdf), and a
[survey](https://swalladge.id.au/posts/2017/08/07/dotfiles-config-survey.html).

A sub goal of this is to learn rust, so the code may be a bit iffy...

GitHub issues are currently used for tracking progress and documenting
lower level requirements.


# Testing
